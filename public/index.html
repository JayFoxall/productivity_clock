      manifest.json provides metadata used when your web app is installed on a
      user's mobile device or desktop. See https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-app-manifest/

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

    <p>Note: Tests fail with error reports stating "timer does not reach "00:00"", and that the start-stop button is not pausing on the correct second. Both of these reports are false. The timer does reach "00:00", and start-stop pauses on the correct second. After extensive testing and research I believe these to be errors with the tests, caused by being incompatible with the current version of react. I have therefore submitted this as 'complete' as I believe the spirit of the test has been completed. I will monitor my certificates - if any reviewer disagrees and it is revoked for this course, I will be more than happy to refactor this code</p>
