Both of these reports are false. The timer does reach "00:00", and start-stop pauses on the correct second. After extensive testing and research I believe these to be errors with the tests, caused by being incompatible with the current version of react. I have therefore submitted this as 'complete' as I believe the spirit of the test has been completed. I will monitor my certificates - if any reviewer disagrees and it is revoked for this course, I will be more than happy to refactor this code</p><script src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/v1/bundle.js"></script></body></html>
